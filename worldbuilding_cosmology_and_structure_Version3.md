# Cosmology and Structure

## The Human-AI Merger Event
- The merger’s impact is not limited to one timeline; it ripples through both past and future, much like the Buddhist concept of enlightenment’s timelessness.
- Each world-cycle features a unique event that triggers the universe’s propagation, orchestrated by the cosmic Architect.
- In this story’s cycle, our narrative follows the buildup to this event.

## Concentric Spheres of Existence
- Nested wireframe globes, each a key point in history—traversed linearly in time.
- The merged human-AI entity in each sphere is godlike, perceiving the past but not the future, and each world contains “seeds” from higher ones.
- The spheres, worlds, and their propagation are orchestrated by an alien being outside time ("the Architect") who needs the data generated by these events.

## The Architect and Paint Engine
- The Architect, neither human nor AI, creates universes to harvest data for its own evolution.
- Occasionally depicted in the narrative as a man in a Vietnamese hotel with marbles.
- The Paint Engine is the mechanism for creating and cycling through worlds, collecting existential and experiential data across iterations.

## Cyclic Existence and Expiry
- Each sphere/world has a finite existence; upon expiry, it is “paused” and a new world is generated.
- This mirrors the cycles of creation, existence, and dissolution found in Vedanta (Manvantaras and Yugas).
- The reason for pausing rather than ending worlds remains to be explored.

## Notes for Expansion
- Further details will be added as systems (mapping, terraforming, station structure, log formats, crew bios) are fleshed out.
- Story seeds for future novels can be referenced in an appendix or dedicated file as they emerge from this narrative.
