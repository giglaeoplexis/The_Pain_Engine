# Story Structure & Narrative Devices

## Protagonist Focus
- (Sections about Kafka, true protagonist, ensemble cast, philosophical exploration, etc., as previously detailed...)

## Communal and Key Spaces

### The Crew Dining Hall
- Inspired by iconic sci-fi settings (e.g., the Nostromoâ€™s dining hall in Alien).
- Central gathering place for the entire crew.
- Used for group meals, meetings, and spontaneous interactions.
- Narrative function: reveals crew dynamics, conflicts, camaraderie, and philosophical debates.

### Observation Lounge
- Dedicated area for private reflection, stargazing, and quiet conversation.
- Will be explored further in later story development.

### Airlock/Disembarkation Zone
- A vivid recurring image: round, white door; fluorescent lighting circling the edge; chrome ladders; a red box or package nearby.
- May serve as a disembarkation zone or hold other narrative significance.
- This airlock image is one of the earliest and clearest visuals for the station, and will help anchor important scenes.
