# How to Collaborate on The Pain Engine

Welcome to The Pain Engine project! This guide explains the workflow, directory structure, and best practices for contributing, whether you’re working solo, inviting human collaborators, or collaborating with an AI assistant.

## 1. Repository Structure

```
ThePainEngine/
├── diaries/           # Final, version-controlled diary/summary files
├── rules/             # Project rules, standards, and templates
├── staging/           # Temporary holding area for new or in-progress files
├── HOW_TO_COLLABORATE.md
└── README.md
```

- **/diaries/**: Merged daily diary and manifest/session summary files (see template in `/rules/`).
- **/rules/**: Documents standards (like this one), templates, and world rules.
- **/staging/**: Non-versioned area for downloading, editing, or reviewing files before moving them to their final location.

## 2. Workflow Overview

1. **Start each session by reviewing the previous diary/summary and any open tasks.**
2. **Download or generate new files into the `staging/` directory.**
3. **Edit, review, and organize files in `staging/` as needed.**
4. **Move finalized files to the appropriate versioned directory (`/diaries/`, `/rules/`, etc.).**
5. **Create a new diary/summary file for the session using the template in `/rules/`.**
6. **Update the session’s diary/summary with goals, files created/edited, tasks completed, and narrative notes.**
7. **Commit and push your changes to the GitHub repository at the end of each session.**
8. **If you suggest workflow or rules changes, record them in the next diary/summary and update `/rules/` as needed.**

## 3. Daily Diary & Manifest File Standard

- **Each session gets a merged diary/summary file (see `/rules/diary_and_summary_file_standard.md`).**
- **Naming convention:** `daily_diary_YYYY-MM-DD_HHMM_VersionX.md`
- **Template:** Copy from `/rules/` and fill out both the manifest/summary and diary/narrative sections.

---

## 4. Collaboration Tips

- **Be descriptive in commit messages and diary/summary file entries.**
- **Reference related files or rules for traceability.**
- **Use the `staging/` area to batch and curate work before versioning.**
- **Update this file or `/rules/` as your process evolves.**
- **Share this guide with all collaborators—humans and AIs alike!**

## 5. Contact & Questions

- For project questions, workflow suggestions, or onboarding new collaborators, reference this file or the latest diary/summary file in `/diaries/`.

Happy building, world-making, and collaborating!
