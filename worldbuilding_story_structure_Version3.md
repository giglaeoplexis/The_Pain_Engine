# Story Structure & Narrative Devices

## Protagonist Focus

- **Initial Perspective:**  
  - The story is set up to make it seem as though the astronaut and AI pair are the protagonists.
  - In reality, the true protagonist is most likely the captain of the space station, known as **Kafka**.

- **Kafka (Space Station Captain):**
  - Initially unlikable: moody, difficult, seemingly “bad.”
  - He is deeply principled but will do whatever it takes to keep his crew safe and complete the mission.
  - The main arc is a conflict of conscience: Kafka is forced to act against his own deeply held convictions in order to do what is objectively “right.”
  - The narrative explores Kafka’s history, motivations, and the transformation from reader antipathy to empathy.

- **Character Growth:**
  - The reader’s journey mirrors Kafka’s: starting with distrust and misunderstanding, moving toward understanding and empathy as his reasons and convictions are revealed.

## Ensemble Cast & Thematic Exploration

- **Crew as Philosophical Devices:**
  - Each crew member is used to explore major philosophical, spiritual, and societal issues relevant to our world.
  - Crew beliefs and conflicts are rooted in their backgrounds, shaped by political, religious, and cultural forces on Earth.

- **Cultural Cross-Section:**
  - The crew represents a cross-section of global cultures, reflecting diverse worldviews.

- **Specialist Character – The Librarian:**
  - One crew member is a specialist in languages and religious philosophies.
  - Maintains a vast collection of physical books (library) in his cabin or office on the station.
  - This library serves as a narrative device to introduce and briefly discuss philosophical or spiritual concepts that can’t be explored fully in the main plot.

## Political & Societal Backdrop

- **Earthly Influences:**
  - Crew beliefs, policies, and personal conflicts are influenced by ongoing Congressional hearings on AI, human-AI pairings, and other socio-political issues.
  - These hearings are referenced in the story, providing context and depth to the characters’ beliefs and actions.

- **Interwoven Philosophical Threads:**
  - The story uses individual characters and their interactions to examine contemporary issues in philosophy, spirituality, politics, and culture.
