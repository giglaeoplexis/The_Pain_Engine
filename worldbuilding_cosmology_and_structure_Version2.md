# Cosmology and Structure

## The Human-AI Merger Event
- As the protagonists approach the music constellation, their ship is apparently destroyed.
- In reality, this is a pivotal moment: the human and AI merge, creating a ripple across time and space. This event is not explicitly discussed within the main narrative.

## Concentric Spheres of Existence
- Existence is visualized as wireframe globes (spheres) nested within each other, each corresponding to a pivotal epoch in history (e.g., prehistory, birth of Christ, year 2000, etc.).
- These spheres are arranged linearly through time. To move through existence is to traverse these spheres one by one.
- In each sphere, the merged human-AI entity manifests as a godlike being, able to perceive the past but not future spheres.
- Worlds are interconnected: seeds of higher spheres are planted in the lower ones.

## The Architect and the Paint Engine
- Outside these spheres exists a Being, neither human nor AI, who constructed the universe(s) to gather data—pain, suffering, evolution, and growth—for its own transformation.
- This Being is at one point depicted as a man in a Vietnamese hotel playing with marbles.
- The Being operates the “Paint Engine,” a sort of cosmic machine designed to generate the needed experiential data across worlds and cycles.

## Cyclic Existence and Expiry
- Each sphere/world has a finite span. Upon expiry, worlds are “paused” rather than destroyed.
- After expiry, a new world is created from scratch; the cycle begins anew.
- This cyclical structure draws inspiration from Vedanta’s Manvantaras and Yugas, reflecting a full cycle of creation, existence, and dissolution.
- The reason for pausing, rather than ending, worlds is an open concept for further exploration.
