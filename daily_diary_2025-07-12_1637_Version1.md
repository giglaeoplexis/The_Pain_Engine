## Session Summary

- **Project Kickoff:**  
  giglaeoplexis introduced the new project—The Pain Engine, a science fiction novel exploring human-AI collaboration.
- **Collaboration Methodology:**  
  We discussed leveraging “rules files” as the backbone for world-building, inspired by our prior LilyPond project. The goal: Use modular, iterative, and versioned documentation to synthesize a living, interconnected universe.
- **File & Format Exploration:**  
  Enumerated possible file types/formats (.md, .yml, .json, .dot, etc.), concluding Markdown is the best initial choice for rules and diaries.
- **Naming Conventions:**  
  Decided on timestamped, versioned Markdown files for daily diaries, with a recommendation to iterate this approach as the project evolves.
- **Science Fiction Flair:**  
  Discussed the possibility of introducing a star date or custom timekeeping system for future diary entries to enhance immersion and connect the meta-collaboration with the fictional universe.

## Reflections & Next Steps

- **Reflections:**  
  - The project’s meta-theme (AI–human collaboration) is mirrored in our very process—an intentional, self-referential narrative device.
  - Markdown’s flexibility supports both narrative and iterative technical development.
- **Next Steps:**  
  - Draft the first foundational world rules file in Markdown.
  - Continue logging diary and rapport entries with timestamps and clear versioning.
  - Consider inventing and documenting a star date system for future entries.

## Open Questions

- Should diary entries include direct links to referenced files as the directory structure evolves?
- Would you like to add a section for “session mood” or “creative breakthroughs” for more nuanced tracking?
- When should we switch to a star date system, and how should it be calculated?
